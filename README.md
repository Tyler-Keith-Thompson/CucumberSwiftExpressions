# CucumberSwiftExpressions

Cucumber supports expressions, a custom alternative to regular expressions. This is a supplemental library for [CucumberSwift](https://github.com/Tyler-Keith-Thompson/CucumberSwift) that can parse these expressions. 

It is possible to use this as a standalone library for parsing Cucumber expressions with Swift. Check out our docs for more info.
