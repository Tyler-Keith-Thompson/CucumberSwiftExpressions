# CucumberSwiftExpressions

Cucumber supports expressions, a custom alternative to regular expressions. This is a supplemental library for [CucumberSwift](https://github.com/Tyler-Keith-Thompson/CucumberSwift) that can parse these expressions. 

It is possible to use this as a standalone library for parsing Cucumber expressions with Swift. [Check out our docs](https://tyler-keith-thompson.github.io/CucumberSwiftExpressions/documentation/cucumberswiftexpressions/) for more info.

## Attributions
Cucumber Expressions grammar and implementation information came from [cucumber-expressions](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-expressions). 

[This static website](https://cucumber.github.io/cucumber-expressions/) allowed me to play with weird edge cases to see expected behavior and correct regex outputs.
